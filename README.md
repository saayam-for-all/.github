Welcome to the Saayam for All Organization - a non-profit charity org run by volunteers!

When we are able to request for a car on Uber/Lyft app and order food on a Doordash app, why can't we request for help on an application? 
This is the main driver for this Saayam project.

If you are interested in participating in this noble cause and help us in our software development, please share your Github id with a simple note about
your skill set. Our project requires React/React Native/Java/Python/Go/Terraform/AWS technology experts.

Please contact Rao Bhethanabotla 408-390-1725 text/WhatsApp or email rao.bhethanabotla@gmail.com.
